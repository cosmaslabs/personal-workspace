# Enhanced Recommendation Engine with Market Segmentation - Development Guide

## Project Overview

This project involves developing an advanced recommendation system that combines customer segmentation techniques with collaborative and content-based filtering to deliver personalized recommendations. The system will segment customers using K-means clustering and deliver targeted recommendations based on segment characteristics and individual preferences.

## Technical Requirements

### Primary Goals

- Implement customer segmentation using K-means clustering
- Develop hybrid recommendation system combining multiple approaches
- Create visualization dashboard for segment analysis
- Build API for recommendation generation
- Demonstrate the system with a realistic dataset (e.g., e-commerce, content)

### Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **Customer Segmentation:** scikit-learn (K-means, PCA, t-SNE)
- **Recommendation Algorithms:**
  - Surprise library for collaborative filtering
  - scikit-learn for content-based filtering
- **API Framework:** Flask with RESTful endpoints
- **Visualization:** Plotly Dash
- **Deployment:**
  - Static content: AWS S3
  - API: Google Cloud Functions
  - Database: MongoDB Atlas (free tier)
