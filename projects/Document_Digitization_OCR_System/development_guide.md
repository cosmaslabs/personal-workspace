# Document Digitization OCR System - Development Guide

## Project Overview

This project involves building a comprehensive document digitization system capable of processing images and PDFs, extracting text through OCR, and enabling search and manipulation of the digitized content. The system is designed to handle 500+ daily scanned documents for a local NGO, improving document management and accessibility.

## Technical Requirements

### Primary Goals

- Process multiple document formats (JPG, PNG, PDF, TIFF)
- Implement high-accuracy OCR with support for various document types
- Create searchable document repository with full-text search capabilities
- Develop user interface for document upload, processing, search, and management
- Enable document categorization and metadata extraction

### Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV, Pillow
- **OCR Engines:**
  - Tesseract OCR (primary engine)
  - Google Cloud Vision API (for complex documents)
- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI
- **Frontend:** React with Material-UI
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch
- **Deployment:**
  - Frontend: GitHub Pages or Netlify
  - Backend: Microsoft Azure App Service
