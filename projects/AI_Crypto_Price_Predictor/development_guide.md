# AI Crypto Price Predictor - Development Guide

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning system that predicts Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price movements with ~68% accuracy. The system combines deep learning approaches with technical analysis indicators and sentiment data to generate short-term (1-7 day) price predictions.

- Create interactive dashboard for users to view predictions and historical performance

### Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Data Collection:**
  - CoinGecko API for historical cryptocurrency data
  - Alpha Vantage API for market indicators
  - PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for sentiment analysis
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Feature Engineering:** TA-Lib, NLTK
- **Model Development:** TensorFlow/Keras for LSTM models, XGBoost
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
- **Deployment:** AWS (EC2/Lambda), GitHub Actions
